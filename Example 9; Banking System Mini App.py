#Objective: Simulate a simple banking app where users can check their balance, deposit money, or withdraw money.

#Conditions:

#If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, print "Insufficient funds."
#If the balance is below a certain threshold (e.g., $10), print a warning.

#Account Balance

while True:
    #Options for the user
    print("\nWelcome to the Banking App")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Deposit Money")
    print("3. Withdraw Money")
    print("4. Exit")
